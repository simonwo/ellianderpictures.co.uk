## Trailer

In 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and into the  history books as the first of only twelve men to walk on the Moon.  
   
   But in 1961 when Kennedy pledged to put a man on the Moon, NASA had  barely put a man into orbit. They had less than 10 years to train a team  of astronauts to overcome the unknown challenges of a mission to the  Moon.  
   
   What followed was a rigorous, intense training period that put America’s  first astronauts through their paces; testing their physical and mental  strength, stamina, flying skills and bravery to ensure they were made  of the right stuff.  
   
   But Centrifuges, probing medical tests and jungle survival training was  just the beginning, planting flags and footprints wasn't enough; the  select few would not only need to pilot the complex spacecraft to and  from the moon but also be skilled photographers, geologists and  scientists.  
   
   Featuring stunning NASA footage and expert interviews with Apollo space  scientists, this inspirational film explores the early days of astronaut  training, following those pioneering pilots from selection to the lunar  surface and back again.  
   
   This is the incredible story of how NASA trained America’s best pilots to fly to the Moon, and take one giant leap for Mankind.
