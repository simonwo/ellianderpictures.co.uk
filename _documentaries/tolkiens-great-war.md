## Synopsis

The first of three documentary films commissioned by King Edward's School, Birmingham as part of their 1914-1918 commemorations - over 1,400 former pupils of King Edwardâ€™s School served in the First World War and 245 lost their lives.

Tolkien fought on the Western Front as a young officer, as did many of his school friends and this film explores his experiences during the First World War and how it shaped his culturally defining works.
