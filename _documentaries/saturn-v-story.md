## Synopsis

In 1961, when President Kennedy pledged to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, no rocket existed with the power or capability to rise to the challenge. In order to win the race to Space, the United States would need to establish a multi-billion dollar space program. One man; Werner Von Braun, believed he had the knowledge and vision to make Kennedy's dream a reality.

With the American public galvanised and the expertise of over 200,000 scientists and engineers, Von Braun masterminded the development of the Saturn V; the rocket that flew 24 men to the Moon and launched the greatest adventure in the history of exploration.

This is the story of the most powerful machine ever built, and the men and women who believed it could fly. Using visual effects, stunning NASA footage and expert interviews with Apollo space scientists, this inspirational film tells the story of the colossal challenges NASA faced to fulfill Kennedy's pledge.

With the accolade of flying 24 men to the Moon, the Saturn V will always be considered one of Mankind's greatest technological achievements.
