## Synopsis

A short documentary to accompany **_Robert Gilson: Memoirs of an Infantry Officer_**, that looks in greater depth at the first day of the Battle of the Somme and why the military plan failed.

Quantifying the true impact of the Somme campaign and whether it helped end the war can be difficult, but even harder is justifying the cost and sacrifice required of those men and that generation 100 years ago.
